        <h2>Why the moon?</h2>
        <p>
          The moon is a quiet mirror: it doesn’t speak, yet every night it tells us we share a sky.
          MicroMood turns that feeling into a living map. Each pulse is a tiny lunar flare—brief, gentle,
          and gone within a day—so we can be honest without leaving a trace.

        <h3>Privacy</h3>
        <p>
          We store only what you share: mood, energy, an optional short thought, and the nearest grid
          of your location. Pulses auto-expire after 24 hours. You also receive a delete token to remove
          your pulse any time. No accounts, no tracking.
